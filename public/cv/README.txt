CV Download Instructions - Multilingual Support
==============================================

To enable multilingual CV download functionality:

1. Place your CV files in this directory: public/cv/
2. Use these exact names:
   - English CV: Gabriel_Castillo_CV_EN.pdf
   - Spanish CV: Gabriel_Castillo_CV_ES.pdf
3. The download will automatically select the correct language based on user preference

Supported formats:
- PDF (recommended): Gabriel_Castillo_CV_EN.pdf, Gabriel_Castillo_CV_ES.pdf
- DOCX: Gabriel_Castillo_CV_EN.docx, Gabriel_Castillo_CV_ES.docx

How it works:
- When language is set to English, it downloads: Gabriel_Castillo_CV_EN.pdf
- When language is set to Spanish, it downloads: Gabriel_Castillo_CV_ES.pdf
- The CV button shows language indicator (EN/ES) for clarity

Note: Make sure both file names match exactly for the download links to work properly.

File structure should be:
public/cv/
├── Gabriel_Castillo_CV_EN.pdf
├── Gabriel_Castillo_CV_ES.pdf
└── README.txt (this file)
